# CLARIX — Ad Playbook (Base44-style short-form video)

Five ready-to-film scripts + production and campaign setup. Format: 15–30s vertical video
(9:16), hook in the first 3 seconds, **real screen recording of CLARIX** as the core, big
auto-captions, one CTA. Make 2–3 hook variants per script; kill losers after ~$20 spend.

**Honesty rule (non-negotiable):** every demo shot is the real product doing real things.
No faked speed-ups without a "sped up" label, no invented stats, no fake testimonials.

**Prerequisite:** set `NEXT_PUBLIC_META_PIXEL_ID` (+ optionally `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY`)
in Railway so conversions (signup / checkout / subscribe) are measurable. Optimize Meta
campaigns for **CompleteRegistration** first; switch to **Subscribe** once you have volume.

## Script 1 — "The 12-second demo" (hero ad, screen-record only)

- **Hook (0–3s)** — text overlay: **"Your meeting notes are already done."** VO: "I haven't
  taken meeting notes in months."
- **Demo (3–18s)** — screen recording: drag an audio file into CLARIX → processing →
  summary, action items, and speakers appear. VO: "Drop in any meeting. CLARIX writes the
  summary, pulls every action item, and tags who said what."
- **Payoff (18–25s)** — click Export → PDF/DOCX; click an action item. VO: "Then it exports
  anywhere you work."
- **CTA (25–30s)** — overlay: **"Start free — no credit card."** VO: "Try it free on your
  next meeting."

## Script 2 — "POV" (UGC / AI-actor talking head)

- **Hook** — actor, deadpan: "POV: you zoned out for the entire meeting and it didn't matter."
- **Body** — cut to screen: CLARIX summary + action items of a real call. Actor VO: "This
  AI listened, wrote the recap, and found the 7 things I was supposed to do."
- **Proof beat** — show Ask CLARIX chat: type "what did we decide?" → answer appears.
- **CTA** — "It's called CLARIX. The free plan covers 3 meetings a month."

## Script 3 — "The bot that shows up for you" (auto-join feature)

- **Hook** — text: **"I sent a robot to my 9am."** VO: "I stopped joining half my meetings."
- **Body** — screen: Settings → connect calendar → auto-join toggle ON. VO: "CLARIX joins
  Zoom, Meet, or Teams for me, records, and writes the recap before I've finished my coffee."
- **Payoff** — dashboard filling with completed meetings + action-item count.
- **CTA** — "Every paid plan starts with a 14-day free trial."

## Script 4 — "Ask your meetings anything" (chat feature)

- **Hook** — text: **"I have a search engine for everything ever said in my meetings."**
- **Body** — screen: Ask CLARIX. Type real questions — "What did we promise the client?" /
  "Show all action items due this week" — answers with citations appear.
- **Payoff** — VO: "It answers from your actual transcripts, with receipts."
- **CTA** — "Start free. Your next meeting is the demo."

## Script 5 — "The cost of forgetting" (pain-first, B2B/LinkedIn angle)

- **Hook** — text: **"That action item you forgot cost you the renewal."** VO: "Most
  follow-ups die in someone's notebook."
- **Body** — screen: meeting → action items extracted → owner + due date → pushed to Notion.
- **Payoff** — VO: "CLARIX catches every commitment in every meeting — automatically."
- **CTA** — "Teams run on CLARIX Pro. Try it free for 14 days."

## Production (cheap + fast)

1. **Screen recording:** OBS (free) at 1080p. Record the *live product* on clean demo data.
   Crop to phone-frame in edit. Speed up waits and label "sped up".
2. **Edit:** CapCut — auto-captions on (most viewers are muted), punch-in zooms on the
   summary appearing, sound effect on the action-items count.
3. **UGC actors:** Arcads or Creatify for Script 2/5 variants (script in → actor video out).
   Voiceover: ElevenLabs. Keep every claim matching the live product.
4. **Volume:** 5 scripts × 2–3 hooks = 10–15 creatives. Refresh hooks weekly; keep winners.

## Campaign setup

| | |
|---|---|
| Channels | Meta (Advantage+ / broad) + TikTok first; LinkedIn later for Script 5 |
| Budget | $20–30/day total to start |
| Destination | Homepage (or `/pricing` for Scripts 3/5) with UTMs, e.g. `?utm_source=meta&utm_campaign=demo12s` |
| Optimize for | CompleteRegistration → later Subscribe |
| Kill rule | No signups after ~$20 on a creative → pause it |
| North star | Cost per free signup, then free→trial→paid rate (PostHog funnel) |

**Before spending a dollar:** custom domain live, Stripe live (checkout tested), pixel firing
(check Meta Events Manager), and one full happy-path test as a brand-new user.
